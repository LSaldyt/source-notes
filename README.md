# Computational Cognitive Science Notes

Primary sources from leading research in computational cognitive science.

General locations for sources:

### Papers:

- Tenenbaum et al:  
    - Human level concept learning through probabalistic program induction [notes](notes/human_level_concept_learning.md).
    - Three ideal observer models for rule learning in simple languages  
    - Computational rationality: A converging paradigm for intelligence in brains, minds, and machines.  
    - How to grow a mind: statistics, structure, and abstraction  
    - The discovery of structural form  
    - Simulation as an engine of physical scene understanding

    - A Theory of how Columns in the Neocortex Enable Learning the Structure of the World
    - Properties of Sparse Distributed Representations and their Application to Hierarchical Temporal Memory
- Barrett:
    - The theory of constructed emotion: an active inference account of interoception and categorization  

### Books:
 - Society of Mind, Marvin Minsky 
 - The Emotion Machine, Marvin Minsky
 - GEB, and other H-books? I'm not sure if this is needed.  

Future Inclusions:  
    - Wolfram  
    - More Barrett?
    - CoCoSci analogous groups at other schools?

TODO:  
    - Individual summary pages for the more important papers
    - Overview papers for grouped research that's less relevant (like the Hawkin's stuff, because of how low-level it is)
    - Citation code for each source
    - Bibliography generation
