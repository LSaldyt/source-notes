Notes on primary sources from similar research groups  

Also, it would be nice to create a collective set of citations, no?  

General locations for sources:   

- Tenenbaum representative [papers](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html)
- MIT CoCoSci [publications](http://cocosci.mit.edu/publications)
- MIT AGI [Various](https://agi.mit.edu/)
- MIT OCW AI [Winston](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010/)
- MIT OCW Society of Mind [Minsky](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-868j-the-society-of-mind-fall-2011/)

Papers:

- Tenenbaum et al:  
 - Three ideal observer models for rule learning in simple languages  
 - Computational rationality: A converging paradigm for intelligence in brains, minds, and machines.  
 - How to grow a mind: statistics, structure, and abstraction  
 - The discovery of structural form  
 - Simulation as an engine of physical scene understanding  
 - Pure Reasoning in 12-Month-Old Infants as Probabilistic Inference  
 - Bayesian models of cognition  
 - Optimal Predictions in Everyday Cognition

- Other:
 - The theory of constructed emotion: an active inference account of interoception and categorization  

Books:
 - GEB, and other H-books? I'm not sure if this is needed.  
 - Society of Mind, because of its influence on our architecture and Tenenbaum's (And on all of CoCoSci).  
Lectures:?
 - Obvious candidates are MIT AGI, MIT Minsky (Society of Mind) and MIT Winston. I'm sure Stanford and other schools have decent lectures too.  

Future Inclusions:  
 - Hawkins  
 - Wolfram
