Notes on primary sources from similar research groups  

Also, it would be nice to create a collective set of citations, no?  

- Tenenbaum representative papers http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html  

- MIT CoCoSci http://cocosci.mit.edu/publications   

- Some Minksy? He has influenced both the FARG architecture and Tenenbaum's architecture (which, in turn, is very similar to our own..)  

Papers:

- Tenenbaum et al:  
 - Three ideal observer models for rule learning in simple languages  
 - Computational rationality: A converging paradigm for intelligence in brains, minds, and machines.
 - How to grow a mind: statistics, structure, and abstraction
 - The discovery of structural form
- Other:
 - The theory of constructed emotion: an active inference account of interoception and categorization
 - Jeff Hawkins

Books:
 - GEB, and other H-books? I'm not sure if this is needed.
 - Society of Mind, because of its influence on our architecture and Tenenbaum's (And on all of CoCoSci).
Lectures:?
 - Obvious candidates are MIT AGI, MIT Minsky (Society of Mind) and MIT Winston. I'm sure Stanford and other schools have decent lectures too.

Future Inclusions:
 - Hawkins
 - Wolfram
