# Computations rationality: A converging paradigm for intelligence in brains, minds, and machines.

### Summary

This paper claims that Artificial Intelligence, Neuroscience, and Cognitive Science are converging on a shared paradigm: That of "computational rationality,: identifying decisions with highest expected utility, while taking into consideration the costs of computation in complex real-world problems in which the most relevant calculations can only be approximated". 

### Hypotheses

Computational rationality is a converging paradigm.

### Methods 

This is an opinion and summary piece, so there are no explicit methods.

### Results

There is evidence in Computer Science, Cognitive Science, and Neuroscience respectively that computational rationality is a model of human decision making. Computationally, modern models of utility-based decisions have been applied to certain limited real-world problems (Watson, google, the stuff on buzzfeed). Psychologically and anatomically, there is evidence that people will consider problems rationally for a limited period of time, and then act quickly and make a decision, even
if it is not the optimal one. 

### Discussion

The authors claim that computational rationality may be a unifying theory of the future.. However, it seems that this view is pretty myopic.

### Takeaways:

Well, often, defining something before having full understanding is limiting. This is one of those cases.
It seems obvious that the mind can be explained more fully by a multitude of paradigms, not any single idea (especially not computational rationality). I think, when explaining our own theories, we should be careful not to claim universality before it is justified, and should probably err on the side of claiming that the theory of mind is composed of multiple theories.

For example, if one really wanted, one could view copycat (et al) as searches for low-temperature (high answer satisfaction) states, but this is a very limited view that prevents seeing the cognitively inspired aspects of copycat.
