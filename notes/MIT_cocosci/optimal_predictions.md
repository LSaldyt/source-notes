# Optimal Predictions in Everyday Cognition

### Summary

This paper questions previous assumptions about the fraility of human predictions.  
Instead, it suggests that many human predictions via implicit probabalistic models are very close to the statistics of the real world.  

IE This is another +1 for Bayesian models of cognition.

### Hypotheses

Work by Kahneman, Tversky et al seems to suggest that cognitive judgements are extremely error prone.  
However, "This view of cognition, based on laboratory studies, appears starkly at odds with the near-optimality of other human capabilities, and with people's ability to make smart predictions from sparse data in the real world"

### Methods 

Several sparse-data prediction questions were chosen, with variance in statistical shapes.
(For example, life span (gaussian) questions were used, but questions about box-office (highly non-gaussian) success were also used, so that the full spectrum of statistical predictions could be covered.)

### Results

Essentially, humans make predictions that match Bayesian models.  
In most everyday predictions, we are very good.  
It is (supposedly) only in the edge cases isolated by Kahneman et al that we perform so poorly.  

"The results of this experiment reveal a far closer correspondence between optimal statistical inference and everyday cognition than suggested by previous research."

### Discussion

An interesting excerpt:  
"Given an unfamiliar prediction task, people might be able to identify the appropriate form of distribution by _making an analogy_ to more familiar phenomena in the same broad class, even if they do not have sufficient direct experience to set the parameters of that distribution accurately"

### Takeaways:

Human mind is good at predictions -- at least in _these_ lab experiments.  
Of course, there are plenty of lab experiments where human prediction breaks down.  

Like all of the papers from this group, it includes good human trails.
