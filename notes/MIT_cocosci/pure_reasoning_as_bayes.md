# Pure Reasoning in 12-month-old Infants as Probabilistic Inference

### Summary

In a nutshell, this is just a hypothesis test of using the Bayes model to explain early cognition.
For the most part, this theory is supported. Interestingly, though, (marginal) shortcomings of this model are reported here.
"Infant's looking times are consistent with a Bayesian idea observer embodying abstract principles of object motion. The model explains infants' statistical expectations and classic qualitative findings about object cognition in younger babies, not originally viewed as probabalistic inference."

### Hypotheses

Bayesian modeling can explain pure reasoning in infants.

### Methods 

Both the model and infants are tested with blockworld-like scenes. They are given questions like: "When this table is pushed, will more red blocks fall off the edge, or will more yellow blocks fall off the edge?," or "When this box is occluded and the bottom is opened, what is most likely to fall out?". Both of these are attempts at explaining common sense in the Minskian sense.

See youtube lectures (On top level README) or this [video](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/332/6033/1054) for examples of the problems discussed.

### Results

There is some correspondence between the model and infants, but it isn't perfect:
"The rich literature on infant perception suggests a need for more sophisticated ideal-observer models, with a more detailed specification of how infants represent the physical properties of objects. Lastly, an ideal-observer model, even with resource and processing constraints, provides only a coarse approximation to the psychological mechanisms of infant cognition. A more fine grainer model might make stronger qualitative predictions. Still, it is intriguiging that, with only
minimal assumptions about how infant's computational resources and their knowledge of object motion, we can explain some of the most basic, early developing abilities to parse the world into a discrete set of objects as rational probabilistic inference"

### Discussion

This paper is written well enough to summarize itself:
"Our work opens the possibility that a cognitive architecture based on probabilistic generative models, complemented by abstract knowledge representations, _can account for early common sense reasoning beyond the limited physical domain that we explored_"
In other words, the group has a strong belief that A. This model _will_ generalize, and B. That this model can be iteratively improved to better approximate the true behavior of an early learner. 

### Takeaways:

This paper does a fair and robust critique/comparison of the Bayesian architecture. I think it is really important that the results indicate generalization is possible, and that increased psychological plausibility is possible. I think that both of these are crucial for pioneering any cognitive architecture, and that our group can (and will/has) take steps along these lines to reach something more general and psychologically accurate.
