# The Discovery of Structural Form

### Summary

This is a Bayesian approach for discovering structural form. Essentially, the algorithm can find partitions, chains, orders, rings, trees, heirarchies, and grids in given data. Each form is grammar-generated. These forms are discussed by psychologists (see bibliography) to be fundamental. 
However, this paper does not claim to "exhaust the set of cognitively natural or scientifically important forms". The authors claim that a tool like this will be useful for data analysis and scientific discovery.

### Hypotheses

A Bayesian structure discovery algorithm can outperform many classical approaches to structure discovery.

### Methods 

Eight structural forms (partitions, chains, orders, rings, heirarchies, trees, grids, and cylinders) were generated from a form grammar. These were then applied to both fabricated data and (cleaned) "real world" data. 

### Results

The algorithm is able to classify structures in many types of data (and presumably is efficient at doing so). 

### Discussion

While the model is successful in what it set out to do, it seems (and is admitted in paper) that there are many other structural forms. It is also admitted that some of the data used is not entirely representative of real world data. However, there are certainly applications for this kind of tool in science.

### Takeaways:

Obviously, this might be comparable to any future clustering algorithm made by our own group. It offers a simple Bayesian approach to perception, but this is seen better in many of the other groups papers. Perhaps it could act as a motivator to apply the copycat model to some domains which will be useful as tools?
