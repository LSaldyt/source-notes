# Hypotheses

This is a very incomplete list of the summarized hypotheses of prominent individuals in cognitive science:
 - Joshua Tenenbaum
   - Strong model/explanation hypothesis
   - Bayesian everything hypothesis
 - Marvin Minsky
   - Strong common sense hypothesis
   - Strong composition hypothesis
 - Patrick Henry Winston
   - Strong story hypothesis
 - Douglas Hofstadter
   - Strong analogy/essence hypothesis
 - Allen, Newell, and Simon
   - Strong goal hypothesis?  

I find it interesting that Minsky is the only one who seems to have multiple advertised hypotheses, given that his main hypothesis is compositionality.
