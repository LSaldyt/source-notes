# B Brain (AKA Self-Watching)

"The B Brain could supervise how the A Brain learns, either by making changes in A directly or by influencing As own learning progress"

For example, the B Brain can resolve loops. See Metacat.

"There is no reason to stop at only two levels. We could connect a C Brain to watch the B Brain, and so on"

This is a pretty simple idea.. It connects, also, to learning how to learn,...

7.5 (Learning and Memory)

Simple behaviorism is obviously not powerful enough... "The answer must lie in learning better ways to learn" 

"At each moment, we must keep track of what we've just done -- or else we might repeat the same steps over and over again. Also, we must somehow maintain our goals -- or we'll end up doing pointless things. Finally, once our problem is solved, we need to access our records of how it was done, for use when similar problems arise in the future" (75)

7.10 (Genius):
Plenty of gems in this section. It is reccomended to read the entire thing.

"I don't believe that there is much of a difference between normal and creative thought".

"It is those simple tricks of mental management that produce systems that create those works of genius" 

"..As for what we call intelligence, my view is tat each person who can speak coherently already has the better part of what our heroes have. Then what makes genius appear to stand apart, if we each have most of what it takes? I suspect that genius needs one thing more: in order to accumulate outstanding qualities, one needs unusually effective ways to learn. It's not enough to learn a lot; one also has to _manage_ what one learns. Those masters have, beneath the surface of their mastery,
some special knacks of 'higher order' expertise, which help them _organize_ and apply the things they learn. It is those hidden tricks of mental management that produce the systems that create those works of genius"
