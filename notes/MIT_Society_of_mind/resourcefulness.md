# Resourcefulness

Minsky famously uses resourcefulness as a synonym for intelligence. His favorite example is that of Feynman, who knew both mathematical representations for quantum activity (Schrodinger's Differential Equations and Heisenberg's Matrix Representations).

"The secret of what anything means to us depends on how we've connected it to all the other things we know. That's why it's almost always wrong to seek the 'real' meaning of anything. A thing with just one meaning has scarcely any meaning at all."

"If you have only one representation and encounter a problem, you get stuck."

"When someone learns something 'by rote' -- that is, with no sensible connections -- we say that they 'do not really understand'. Rich meaning networks, however, give you many different ways to go: if you can't solve a problem one way, you can try another. True, too many indiscriminate connections will turn a mind to mush. But well-connected meaning-structures let you turn ideas around in your mind, to consider alternatives and envision things from many perspectives until you find one that
works. And that's what we mean by thinking" (64).

30.8 (The final essay):

Consider hybrid vigor in genetics/biology: "Each dimension of our thought gives us toughness and versatality. They offer alternative ways to proceed when any part of the system fails"

And of course, "The power of intelligence stems from our vast diversity, not from any single perfect principle" (308).
