# Memory

My notes say: "Read all of this. It is A+".

Essentially, agent-groups can be stored and associated with different concepts: this is the essential part of the FARG architecture, where codelet groups are spawned when concepts are activated.

In lecture, Minsky refers to this broader theory as "K-lines," and he talks about it quite a lot.

Also essential, this is how agents are _organized_, which is a key feature in Minsky's theory...

So, please, read it all ;). Most of the pages are heavily underlined.. So no need to type them all up again when they're already out in the ether.

15.6:

"The brain has no single, common memory system. Instead, each part of the brain has several types of memory-agencies that work in somewhat different ways, to suit particular purposes"
