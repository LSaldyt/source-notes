# Society of Mind

### Summary

This page acts as an index to deeper notes on the book.
Society of Mind is an older (1986) book, which influenced both FARG and the Tenenbaum group, as well as many others. 
The book is mostly theory, in (as Minsky calls it) a novelist fashion.
Essentially, the idea is that some sort of explanation must be made and tested, even if it is wrong.

Here's the core: "The power of intelligence stems from our vast diversity, not from any single, perfect principle" (308).
