# Analogy

"How do we every understand anything? Almost always, I think, by using one or another kind of _analogy_ -- that is, by representing each new thing as though it resembles something we already know" (57). 

I find it interesting, however, the understated role that analogy plays in Minsky's architecture, as compared to the role it plays in our own.

See 29.8 as well.

Most analogical influence comes from H, so no need to restate.
