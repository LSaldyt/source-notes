"Our puppet strings are hard to see,\ So we percieve ourselves as free, \ Convinced that no mere objects could\ Behave in terms of bad and good.\ \ To you, we mannikins seem less, than live, because our consciousness is that of dummies, made to sit \ on laps of gods and mouth their wit \ \ Are you, our transcendental gods, \ likewise dangled from your rods \ and need, to show spontaneous charm, \ some higher god's inserted arm? \ \ We seem to form a nested set, \ with each the next one's
marionette, \ who, if you asked him, would insist, \ that he (or she)'s the last ventriloquist." - Theodore Melnechuk

(47).
