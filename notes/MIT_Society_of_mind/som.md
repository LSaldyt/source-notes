# Society of Mind

From 4.3: "The art of a great paining is not in any one idea, nor in a multitude of separate tricks for placing all those pigment spots, but in the great network of relationships among its parts. Similarly, the agents, raw, that make our minds are by themselves as valueless as aimless, scatter daubs of paint. What counts is what we make of them.. The value of human self lies not in some small, precious core, but in its vast, constructed crust" (41).

5.3: "A single, central Self doesn't explain anything. This is because a thing with no parts provides nothing tat we can use as pieces of explanation" (50).

28.8:

"..It can make sense to think these exists, inside your brain, a society of different minds. Like members of a family, the different minds can work together to help each other, each still having its own mental experiences that the others never know about. Several such agencies could have many agents in common, yet still have no more sense of each other's interior activities than do people whose apartments share opposite sides of the same wall"
