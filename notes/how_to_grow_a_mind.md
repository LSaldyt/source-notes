# How to Grow a Mind: Statistics, Structure, and Abstraction

### Summary

This paper discusses converging paradigms. Most notable are the combination of implicit and explicit knowledge representations. The authors argue that, through a bayesian approach, many limiting dichotomies are left behind. The authors also argue for a stronger emphasis on cognitive testing and reverse engineering as methods for creating intelligence machines.

### Hypotheses

A blended Bayesian/symbolic approach will allow for "basic" cognitive science to be performed.

### Methods 

The architecture in general is described: "Bayesian models typically combine richly structured, expressive knowledge representations with powerful statistical inference engines, arguing that only a synthesis of sophisticated approaches to both knowledge representation and inductive inference can account for human intelligence"

### Results

Summarizing the results of their other papers, the Tenenbaum group argues that their architecture is well suited for performining "true" cognitive science.

### Discussion

The essential principle being applied here, as I see it, is Marvin Minsky's society of mind. I quoted it earlier, but, "Only a synthesis of sophisticated approaches to both knowledge representation and inductive inference can account for human intelligence".

### Takeaways:

Most of the conclusions in this paper are top notch. As discussed in the other reviews, there is a lot to be learned from the Tenenbaum group. 
The only part I question is their division of human intelligence into inductive inference and knowledge representation. Surely these two things are important, but I think the Tenenbaum group would agree (and has discussed, elsewhere) that there is more to human intelligence than simply these two components. Accordingly, I imagine that a true step toward "Growing a Mind" would include synthesis of several principles.. But either way, the work done here by Tenenbaum et al is a crucial step.
