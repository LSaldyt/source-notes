With a little industry and application, anyone who is willing to
extricate himself from the system of shared ideology and propaganda will
readily see through the modes of distortion developed by substantial
segments of the intelligentsia. Everybody is capable of doing that. If
such analysis is often carried out poorly, that is because, quite
commonly, social and political analysis is produced to defend special
interests rather than to account for the actual events.

The alleged complexity, depth, and obscurity of these questions is part

theory dealing with ideology and its social bases. That's possible, but
it isn't necessary in order to understand, for example, what induces

1\. Is it possible to present a significant theoretical analysis of this?
Answer: Yes, in principle. And this type of work might attain a level at
which it would require special training, and form, in principle, part of
science. 2. Is such a science necessary to remove the distorting prism
imposed by the intelligentsia on social reality? Answer: No. Ordinary
skepticism and application is sufficient.

One might even argue that to deal with substantive issues in the
ideological disciplines may be a dangerous thing, because these
disciplines are not simply concerned with discovering and explaining the
facts as they are; rather, they tend to present these facts and
interpret them in a manner that conforms to certain ideological
requirements, and to become dangerous to established interests if they
do not do so.

The United States is unusual among the industrial democracies in the
rigidity of the system of ideological control---"indoctrination," we
might say---exercised through the mass media. One of the devices used to
achieve this narrowness of perspective is the reliance on professional
credentials. The universities and academic disciplines have, in the
past, been successful in safeguarding conformist attitudes and
interpretations, so that by and large a reliance on "professional
expertise" will ensure that views and analyses that depart from
orthodoxy will rarely be expressed.

psychology (such as visual perception, formation of theories about the
