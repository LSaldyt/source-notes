Contributing to this repository is easy. To add notes, copy the [template](notes/template.md) in the notes directory and fill it out. For an example of a filled template, see [this paper](notes/MIT_cocosci/simulation.md). Using the template and including LaTeX bibliography information is very helpful, because then papers are easily cited.
